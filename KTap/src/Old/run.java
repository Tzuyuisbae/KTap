 * Description: Rhythm game where the user interacts with the music. Notes fall 
 * down from the top of the screen towards a line near the bottom. The user must
 * press the appropriate keyboard key depending on which column the note is in.
 * The user must also hold down on the key for the entire duration of the note as
 * it passes through the line. There is a health bar that will go down each time
 * the user misses a note or presses a key when there is no note in range. There
 * is a combo counter that goes up each time the user successfully plays a note
 * and resets when the user misses. There is also a label that updates and 
 * displays the user's score as they play. After the game is over, the user is 
 * brought to an end screen that displays the user's score, high score, performance,
 * number of perfect, good, and okay hits, and the number of notes missed. 
 * 
 * Areas of Concern: Notes may be out of sync if the computer used does not perform
 * very well. May be fixed if the user modifies the delay on the timer(GameTimer 
 * class, line 13, 3rd number)
